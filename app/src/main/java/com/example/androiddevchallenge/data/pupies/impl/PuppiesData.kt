We are sure he will settle in and become a wonderful friend. If you choose to take Kaloe home, you will need to prepare to give him plenty of time to settle into your home environment. He will do best in a home that currently has outgoing, friendly dogs to learn from. He will benefit from his family using fear-free handling. Here is a link to the Fear Free Happy Homes program. https://fearfreehappyhomes.com/ check it out to learn more about the best ways to reduce stress in the home for a fearful dog.",
